それぞれ単純加算(add_stats)、%調整(multiply_stats)、全装備平均(add_average_stats)の３つの実装方法(manpowerのみ単純加算)。

build_cost_ic = 0.4             # Production Cost - How much factory output this piece of equipment needs
manpower = 300                  # Manpower - Cost in manpower to produce
reliability = 0.9               # Reliability - The lower the reliability, the more likely the equipment will suffer random failure
naval_speed = 28                        # Max Speed - maximum speed in kilometres per hour of the ship, higher means faster in combat and contributes to evasion

lg_armor_piercing = 12                  # Light gun armor piercing - Determines how much armor ship's light gun attack can pierce
lg_attack = 18                          # Light gun attack - How much damage the ship does with light guns (more effective against screens)
hg_armor_piercing = 25                  # Heavy gun armor piercing - Determines how much armor ship's heavy gun attack can pierce
hg_attack = 12                          # Heavy gun attack - How much damage the ship does with heavy guns (more effective against capitals and carriers)
torpedo_attack = 1                      # Torpedo attack - How much damage we can do when using the ship's torpedos (more effective against capitals and carriers)
anti_air_attack = 5                     # Anti-air - How much anti-air firepower the ship carries for shooting down enemy planes
shore_bombardment = 8                   # Shore Bombard - Ship's ability to help out in land battles neighbouring its sea province when on Hold mission (OBSOLETE, lg_attack and hg_attack determine shore bombardment)
evasion = 15                            # Evasion - Ship's ability to evade enemy fire through maneuvering. (OBSOLETE, naval_speed contributes to evasion instead)

surface_visibility = 25                 # Surface Visibility - How easy to find this ship is (lower is better)
